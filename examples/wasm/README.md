# freeverb-wasm

This is an example of taking the freeverb library and making it available as
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

The approach taken is mostly following this
[wasm-bindgen tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/basic-usage.html).

To try out the example in a browser, `cd` into this folder, and run:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
